request Software-Developers - Project


Hello all dears (software developers / ops etc.)

I am a private person with an idea.
This idea I do not trust myself to implement and am therefore looking for
a software developer, who supports.

Although I have the ability to develop software, but
it hapert at different places, whereby I lack the experience or knowledge,
to catch up or to acquire these laboriously, I lack the time.

For interested software developers I give gladly information over a personal discussion (Chat, E-Mail etc.)
these can be announced only superficially until modalities and conditions were clarified.

General information about the upcoming project:

Topic: Document Management
Platform: univ. (Windows7,10,11 ; Linux (all) - must Debian ; IOS ; Android - MobilePhone ... maybe more?)
preferred programming language: JAVA (uni crosscompile, universal) - like JDownloder (for desktop platforms; mobile maybe other?)
or "docker" project
Mainkey: Storage, ORC, Structure, File-saving
Release: GitHub - free Project (worldwide free project) - openCode Project
application areas: private; school/education; administration; business
more, later...

If you are interested please contact me:

Many thanks and kind regards
Sebastian
